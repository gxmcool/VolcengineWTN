## Community SDK

WTN provides community SDK based on WebRTC native SDK. You can integrate the SDK in your client App to access WTN.

The community SDK implements the ability to publish and subscribe to streams and control a small number of audio and video device functions. You can also refer to the implementation of the community SDK and build you own client SDK.
